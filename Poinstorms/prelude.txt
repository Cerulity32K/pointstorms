# The Project
This project uses OpenGL, GLFW, and ImGui to display an editable, point-based, attribute-less vertex shader, as well as configurable uniforms.

# Anemoia
I have a sort of anemoia for the rise of the Internet.
I don't know if this is all survivorship bias, but back then, everything just seemed fun.

People created tons of personal websites.
Cracked software had really cool intros and songs.
Even malware was really cool.
Not to mention skeuomorphism, bevelling, and a bunch of other tiny details that just existed everywhere.

Now, it feels like we've lost that aesthetic.

The Internet has become mostly a subset of a few dozen websites. YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat are some examples (and don't forget Stack Overflow).
All of them have minimal or similar designs and have little personality (becuase they aren't personal at all; they're made by corporations).
And while there are incredibly cool projects (Furnace Tracker, Godot, and Cargo all come to mind), it feels like the Internet as a whole has dropped that general playfulness.

We have so much more technology available to us, but it feels like in total, we are less creative.

So have fun. Make stuff. Small or large, bad or good, tech or art, just make something.

In fact, here's a list of creative FOSS projects I use.
Use whatever you want to make anything you want, these are just the ones I use (in order from easy to use -> harder to use):
## Art/Media
- VLC Media Player - A robust media player that supports many formats and can interpret files that other programs may not be able to (due to corruption).
- Audacity - An incredibly featureful audio editor with editing capabilities ranging from individual samples to entire hours.
- Inkscape - A vector-based art program that integrates with SVG.
- Krita - A raster-based art program that supports animations.
- Kdenlive - A standard and batteries-included video editor capable of many effects.
- Shotcut - An alternative to Kdenlive. Slightly more featureful at the cost of performance.
- Blender - An incredibly powerful 3D modeller, animator, rigger, and so much more.
- Furnace - A massive chiptune tracker that supports chips ranging from the NES and Atari eras all the way to the Amiga.
- OpenMPT - A module tracker that supports Amiga modules all the way to Impulse Tracker modules. Furnace passes the torch to OpenMPT for computer tracker modules.
- FFmpeg - A multimedia encoder that supports tons of formats and has lots of filters and options. Fun fact: This is the backend for many video editors, audio editors, converters, etc.

## Programming
- JetBrains Mono - A font that focuses on developer ergonomics. It supports many readable ligatures, is easy to read, is very unambiguous, and honestly just looks cool.
- VS Code - An extremely extendable code editor that can be configured to become a full IDE for many languages. (Personally, I use a modification of the 1984 theme).
- Godot - A high-level game engine where games can be written in its own scripting language, C# or any language that compiles to a DLL.
- Dear ImGui - A batteries-included GUI library that is incredibly easy to use compared to other forms of UI. Used in this project!
- Raylib - A lower-level, but intuitive graphics library that allows you to create 2D or 3D games without any extra setup.
- Rust - A memory-safe, system-level, yet abstract language that is designed to compile and run forever.
- GLFW - A low-level window manager built to interact with low level graphics libraries. Used in this project!
- OpenGL - An extremely low-level graphics library. Used in this project!
- Vulkan - An immensely verbose and customizable graphics library that runs even closer to bare-metal than OpenGL.
