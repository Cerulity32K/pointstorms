# Pointstorms
A toy program meant for OpenGL vertex shader experimentation.
**Currently unfinished.** The UI is something I would like to improve upon in the near future, but the program is still very functional.

# Usage
Press O to open the options menu. You will see the uniforms at the top, a spot to add your own uniforms, and rotation speed and color below.
There is also a text area where you can edit the vertex shader used in the program, and it will recompile live.
If you get stuck writing the shader and can't get it to work, there is a button that will bring you back to the most recent version of the shader that works.

Press D to open up the demo list. Here, you can choose presets for the different drawable objects this program supports. (hold shift for secret demos ;) )

# Future
This program has a large base because it is part of a larger program I'm brewing up, that will be a node-based FOSS motion graphics compositor, and I hope to be able to make things with the same amount of quality as Adobe After Effects.
